# Background

Destination prediction plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, including city governance, emergency regulation, and location-based services.   
It is the key to understanding human mobility and supporting policymaking from travel demand estimation, traffic congestion, and transit planning.   
To answer these questions, agent-based models are widely applied to simulate human mobility at the citywide level. However, present studies are facing two major limitations.   

1. Modeling paradigm involves observed partial trajectories or historical visited locations for training and prediction. Even though recent location-based services enable communication, navigation, and smartphone application companies to collect human mobility data, it is still challenging to apply existing models to the population without historical mobility data. 
2. Differences in city topologies and functions prevent us to transfer the trained models from city to city.

# Goals to be achieved

1. Using the data collected from multiple metropolitan areas, you are challenged to develop a robust and generalizable model to predict the individual's daily trip destination based on easy-collected information and features. 
2. Using the models trained on the data before, predict the trip destination for a new metropolitan area.
